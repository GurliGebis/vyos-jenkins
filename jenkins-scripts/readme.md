Here I post some scripts as example how to manage Jenkins automatically.

In order to make scripts work you need to create API token update script to use your credentials.

Jenkins setup
--

**User account (click on your username - top-right corner) -> Configure**

**API Token -> Current token(s) -> Add new Token**

```
Name: CLI
```

-> Generate -> [copy generated key and save it for later use]
